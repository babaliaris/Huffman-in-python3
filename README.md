# Huffman-in-python3


***Please note that this algoritm is just a test i did to learn how to create the huffman algorithm, so it's quit slow.
For files more than 1 mb, the decompression process with take ages!!!***

### Requirements:
* Python3

### How To Use:
* Just double click the **huffman.pyw** and you will get the rest.

### What Does This Repository Contain?
* The **huffman.pyw** is a user interface just for testing the code.
* Inside the **source_files** directory you can find all the modules which construct's the algorithm.
* There is an example **.txt** file which you can use for testing the algorithm.


### What Is The Structure Of The Algorithm?
Coder is the Top Level Module.

* ***coder.py*** <-- **alphabet.py**, **priority_queue.py**, **node.py**, **scanner.py**

* ***alphabet.py*** <-- **node.py**, **scanner.py**

* ***priority_queue.py*** <-- **node.py**
