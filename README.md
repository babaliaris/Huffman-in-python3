# Huffman-in-python3

### Requirements:
* Python3

### How To Use:
* Just double click the **huffman.pyw** and you will get the rest.

### What Does This Repository Contain?
* The **huffman.pyw** is a user interface just for testing the code.
* Inside the **source_files** directory you can find all the modules which construct's the algorithm.
* There is an example **.txt** file which you can use for testing the algorithm.


### What Is The Structure Of The Algorithm?
* *coder.py* <-- alphabet.py, priority_queue.py, node.py, scanner.py

* alphabet.py <-- node.py, scanner.py

* priority_queue.py <-- node.py
